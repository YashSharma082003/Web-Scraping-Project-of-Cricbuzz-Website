# Web-Scraping-Project-of-Cricbuzz-Website

This is Web Scrapping Project of Cricbuzz Website. In this project I used those packages:

Requests — for downloading the HTML code from the Cricbuzz Website URL
BeautifulSoup4 — for extracting data from the HTML string
Pandas — to gather my data into a dataframe for further processing
